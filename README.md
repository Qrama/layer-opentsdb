# Overview

OpenTSDB is a scalable time series database built on top of Hadoop and HBase. It simplifies the process of storing and analyzing large amounts of time-series data generated by endpoints like sensors or servers.

# Usage

Deploy the OpenTSDB charm (link aanpassen):
```sh
juju deploy opentsdb
```
For OpenTSDB to work relations are needed with Zookeeper and HBase:
```sh
juju deploy Zookeeper
```
```sh
juju deploy HBase
```
It is possible that HBase and Zookeeper need additional relations so you will
have to deploy those too. For example HBase needs the hadoop-plugin to work.

To access OpenTSDB's GUI you have to expose OpenTSDB:
```sh
juju expose opentsdb
```
Browse to the public IP with port to see OpenTSDB's GUI. Here you can select
metrics and graph them.
